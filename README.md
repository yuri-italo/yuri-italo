<h1>Hi there, WELCOME to my github! ðŸ‘‹</h1>

## About me :mortar_board:
My name is Yuri Italo, I live in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, currently I am studying Information Systems at <a href="https://newtonpaiva.br">Centro UniversitÃ¡rio Newton Paiva</a>. Very early in my life, I started to fall in love with technology. This love has helped me develop a very good technological mindset, and gave me the curiosity to learn more.<br> 

## ðŸŒ± Things I am currently working on: 
- Finish my Information System degree 
- Taking online courses about Java, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript  
- Finding a new job

## :muscle: Things I am challenging myself with:
- Waking up earlier to make good use of the day
- Coding at least 4 hours a day
- Improving my CV with some education apart from university
