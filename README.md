## About me :mortar_board:
I am a student, currently studying in Vellore Institute of Technology. From very early on in my life, I started to fall in love with technology 😍 This love has helped me develop a very good technological mindset, and given me the curiosity to learn more. I firmly believe that **no amount of knowledge is enough knowledge**. 🧠
